# Labor Ledger dApp Overview

Labor Ledger is a decentralized application designed to create, manage, and monitor fair working conditions through smart contracts. It combines multiple components to ensure transparent, verifiable, and equitable work arrangements while protecting worker rights and enabling efficient dispute resolution.

## Core Components

### Work Contracts
At the heart of the system is the WorkContract, which manages the relationship between workers and employers. Each contract integrates with various modules to handle:
- Payments and escrow
- Work verification
- Grievance handling
- Compliance monitoring
- Survey management
- Reputation tracking

### Contract Factory
The WorkAgreementFactory serves as the main entry point for contract creation, providing:
- Template management for different work types
- Compliance requirement configuration
- Dispute settings management
- Stakeholder validation
- Initial deposit handling

### Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)
The system features two complementary DAOs:

**WorkerDAO**
- Serves as a mutual aid society for workers
- Manages welfare fund and benefits
- Provides tiered membership (BASIC → ACTIVE → CORE → ELDER)
- Participates in dispute resolution
- Monitors compliance standards

**EmployerDAO**
- Focuses on arbitrator selection
- Maintains employer representation
- Conducts regular arbitrator elections
- Participates in compliance setting
- Manages employer reputation standards

### Reputation System
The reputation registry provides comprehensive scoring with:
- Multiple scoring factors (completion, timeliness, quality, etc.)

- TimeClockOracle: Manages time-based verification
- MultiOracle: Combines multiple verification methods

### Payment Structures
Supports multiple payment models:
- TimeBasedPayment: Hourly/shift-based work
- PieceRatePayment: Unit-based compensation
- MilestonePayment: Project-based deliverables
- CustomPayment: Hybrid payment structures
- Escrow management for payment security
- Dispute-triggered payment holds

### Survey Mechanism
